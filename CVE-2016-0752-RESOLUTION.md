# CVE-2016-0752 Resolution Summary

## Issue Analysis

The reported issue referenced CVE-2016-0752, a directory traversal vulnerability in Ruby on Rails Action View component, claimed to affect this repository.

## Investigation Findings

After thorough analysis of the repository:

1. **No Ruby/Rails Code**: This repository contains zero Ruby or Rails files
2. **Technology Stack**: Only Terraform, CloudFormation, and Bash scripts
3. **Repository Purpose**: AWS infrastructure misconfiguration testing
4. **No Dependencies**: No package.json, Gemfile, or any dependency management files

## Root Cause

The issue appears to be:
- A **false positive** from an automated security scanner
- Potentially **misfiled** - meant for github.com/crowdtilt/crowdtiltopen (referenced in the issue)
- Metadata confusion in security scanning systems

## Resolution Actions Taken

To prevent future confusion and clarify the repository scope:

### 1. Created SECURITY.md
- Documents repository scope and purpose
- Explicitly states technologies used
- Contains CVE-2016-0752 non-applicability notice
- Provides clear security policy

### 2. Created NOT_AFFECTED_CVES.md
- Lists CVEs incorrectly flagged against this repository
- Documents CVE-2016-0752 with detailed explanation
- Provides verification commands
- References relevant documentation

### 3. Updated README.md
- Added "Technologies" section listing what IS used
- Added explicit statement about what is NOT used
- Added security policy references
- Improved clarity about repository purpose

## Verification

```bash
# Verify no Ruby/Rails files exist
find . -name "*.rb" -o -name "Gemfile*" -o -name "*.gemspec"
# Result: No files found

# Verify no web application frameworks
find . -name "package.json" -o -name "requirements.txt" -o -name "composer.json"
# Result: No files found
```

## Impact

- **Entity Risk Score**: No change (false positive resolved through documentation)
- **Account Security Score**: No change (vulnerability never existed in this repository)
- **Repository Clarity**: Significantly improved through new documentation

## Conclusion

**CVE-2016-0752 does NOT affect this repository** as it contains no Ruby on Rails code. The issue has been resolved by:
1. Documenting the non-applicability
2. Adding comprehensive security documentation
3. Clarifying repository scope and technology stack

This prevents future misfiled security issues and provides clear guidance for security scanners and contributors.
