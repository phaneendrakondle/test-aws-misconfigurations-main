# Security Notice

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This Repository Contains Intentional Vulnerabilities

This repository is designed for **security testing, education, and training purposes only**. It contains:

1. **Intentionally misconfigured AWS infrastructure** (Terraform and CloudFormation files)
2. **Vulnerable Ruby on Rails dependencies** (CVE-2016-0752 demonstration)
3. **Insecure code examples** for educational purposes

## Purpose

The vulnerabilities in this repository serve to:

- **Train security professionals** on identifying and remediating vulnerabilities
- **Test security scanning tools** (Snyk, Bundler Audit, CodeQL, Checkov, etc.)
- **Validate DevSecOps pipelines** and CI/CD security checks
- **Demonstrate security best practices** by showing both vulnerable and secure code
- **Provide hands-on learning** for penetration testing and security research

## Security Scanner Findings Are Expected

If you run security scanners on this repository, you **will** find vulnerabilities. This is intentional and expected:

### Expected Findings:

1. **CVE-2016-0752** - Directory Traversal in Action View (Rails 4.2.5)
   - Severity: HIGH (CVSS 7.5)
   - Location: `Gemfile` specifies vulnerable Rails 4.2.5
   - Status: ‚úÖ **INTENTIONAL** for demonstration

2. **CSRF Protection Not Enabled** - In `vulnerable_controller_example.rb`
   - Location: VulnerableController class
   - Status: ‚úÖ **INTENTIONAL** - demonstrates vulnerable patterns

3. **Path Injection** - In `vulnerable_controller_example.rb`
   - Location: File rendering with user input
   - Status: ‚úÖ **INTENTIONAL** - demonstrates CVE-2016-0752

4. **AWS Misconfigurations** - In Terraform and CloudFormation files
   - Public S3 buckets
   - Overly permissive security groups
   - Unencrypted storage
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - Status: ‚úÖ **INTENTIONAL** for security testing

## What This Repository Is NOT

‚ùå **This is NOT production code**  
‚ùå **Do NOT copy these configurations to production systems**  
‚ùå **Do NOT deploy these resources in production environments**  
‚ùå **Do NOT use these code patterns in real applications**

## Safe Usage Guidelines

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use in isolated test/lab environments only
- Use for security training and education
- Use to test security scanning tools
- Use to validate DevSecOps pipelines
- Use to learn about vulnerabilities and their mitigations
- Clean up all deployed resources after testing

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Deploy in production environments
- Use on systems with real user data
- Leave test resources running (they will incur costs)
- Test on systems you don't own or have permission to test
- Share credentials or sensitive data

## Secure Alternatives Are Provided

For each vulnerability demonstrated, this repository also provides:

1. **Documentation** on how to fix the vulnerability
2. **Secure code examples** showing proper implementation
3. **Detection scripts** to identify vulnerable configurations
4. **Remediation guidance** with step-by-step fixes

### Examples:

- `vulnerable_controller_example.rb` contains **both** vulnerable and secure code patterns
- `CVE-2016-0752-README.md` explains the vulnerability **and** how to fix it
- `VULNERABILITY-TESTING.md` provides testing **and** remediation steps

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover **genuine** security issues in this educational repository (i.e., vulnerabilities that were not meant to be there for demonstration purposes), please report them responsibly:

1. Open a GitHub issue with the label "security"
2. Describe the unintentional vulnerability
3. Provide steps to reproduce (if applicable)
4. Do not publicly disclose before we've had a chance to review

## Compliance with Security Policies

This repository is in compliance with security best practices because:

1. ‚úÖ **Clearly documented purpose** - All files include warnings
2. ‚úÖ **Educational value** - Demonstrates both problems and solutions
3. ‚úÖ **No real credentials** - All credentials are dummy/example values
4. ‚úÖ **Controlled environment** - Intended for isolated test environments only
5. ‚úÖ **Detection guidance** - Includes tools to identify vulnerabilities
6. ‚úÖ **Remediation guidance** - Provides fix instructions for all issues
