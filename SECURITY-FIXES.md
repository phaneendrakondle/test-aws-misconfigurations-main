## CVE-2016-0752: Directory Traversal Vulnerability in Action View

### Summary
A directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2016-0752) was identified in Action View, a component of Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files by exploiting an application's unrestricted use of the `render` method and providing a `..` (dot dot) in a pathname.

### Risk Assessment
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **CVSS Score:** 7.5
- **Vulnerability Type:** Library Vulnerability

### Affected Versions
- Action View before 3.2.22.1
- Action View 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1
- Action View 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1

### Remediation
Updated Action View to version **5.2.8.1** which is well above the minimum secure versions:
- 3.2.22.1+ for 3.x series
- 4.1.14.1+ for 4.1.x series
- 4.2.5.1+ for 4.2.x series
- 5.0.0.beta1.1+ for 5.x series

### Files Modified
- `Gemfile`: Added Rails dependency with version constraint `~> 5.2.0`
- `Gemfile.lock`: Locked Action View to secure version 5.2.8.1

### Verification
The fix can be verified by checking the `actionview` version in `Gemfile.lock`:

```bash
grep "actionview" Gemfile.lock
```

Expected output should show version 5.2.8.1 or higher.
